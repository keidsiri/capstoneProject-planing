### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* Main language I will use is Javascript and its library ( React Native) to build an application.
* HTML, CSS 
* Using Firestore database 
* Possibly using Expo to deploy the website 

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* I would love to implement more functionalities such as messenger that user can message to each other 
* Be able to post short clip video similar to Instagram story that users can post short clip video on their story for 24 hours.
* User be able to like the posted story also.

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
- OAuth

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I hope to do this project with React that we are learning ( I still need a lot of study )  and also I want to learn something new like Firestore after watching tutorial and reading some documents that I found.
